# Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics Python Package
Applying Computational Science and Engineering (ACSE-4): Team Arctic

This project is a basic SPH simulator. Written in python 3. The package has many helpful user features for running the simulator: Command line programme, Data file outputs, MP4 movie generation.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```
Give examples
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running
